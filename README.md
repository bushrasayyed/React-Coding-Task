## Approach  
- Started by creating reusable components in a React app, including a sidebar, header, overview, and other sections.  
- Designed and implemented CSS separately for each component to ensure reusability and maintainability.  
- Followed a structured component-based architecture for better scalability and modularity.

## Tools and Frameworks Used  
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.  
- **Chart.js**: For creating interactive and visually appealing charts.  
- **FontAwesome (React/Fa)**: For using scalable and customizable icons.

## Challenges Faced  
1. **Working from Figma Design to Code**:  
   - This was my first experience translating a Figma design into a functional application.  
   - It took significant effort to understand the Figma file's structure and adapt it into the code.
    

2. **CSS Maintenance**:  
   - Maintaining consistent and clean CSS styling across components was challenging.  
   - To overcome this, I avoided libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design, focusing instead on writing custom CSS to align with the design requirements.
